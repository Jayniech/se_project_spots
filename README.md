**Intro**

This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. To do this, I used the grid property to display thee card elements into columns and rows. I also used the flex box property to arange the header. In order to make the webpage responsive, I used media queries to adjust elements as the screen size changes.
